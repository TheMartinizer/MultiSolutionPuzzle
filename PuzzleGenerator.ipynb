    "# Generating puzzles with multiple solutions\n",
    "Puzzles with multiple solutions can create very interesting effects, such as the puzzle shown in the video \"[How can a jigsaw have two distinct solutions?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5nElEbbnfU)\" on the Stand-Up Maths Youtube channel where the two ways of solving the jigsaw puzzle either create an image of a coffee cup or a donut. This page describes how such puzzles can be generated by first picking a random scrambling of the puzzle pieces, and then generating a puzzle that is solvable in both its unscrambled and scrambled state. There is also Python code."

    "# Describing puzzles using vectors\n",
    "In order for a jigsaw puzzle to be solvable in more than one way, there must be several connections between pieces that have the same shape. Otherwise, if every connection was unique, each side of a piece would only be able to connect with a single side of a single other piece, and there would only be a single solution to the puzzle. This means that each side of each puzzle piece can be grouped with other puzzle piece sides with a similar shape, and these groups can be given numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to give the shapes numbers so that shapes that are compatible with each other have inverse numbers. For example, shape 1 is compatible with shape -1, shape 2 is compatible with shape -2, and so forth. This makes it easy to check whether two shapes are compatible: they are compatible if they add up to 0, and incompatible if they do not. I prefer to think of the positive numbers as all the shapes that stick out and the negative numbers as the indented shapes, but this is fully arbitrary. Finally, the outer sides of the pieces at the edge of the jigsaw puzzle are just shaped like straight lines, and do not connect to anything. These non-connecting shapes are labelled 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "A puzzle can be described mathematically as a vector containing the shapes of each side of all the pieces of the puzzle. The order of the sides is also arbitrary, but here we order the sides in order left, top, right, bottom, starting with the top left piece and going row by row. The ordering of sides for a 2x2 puzzle is illustrated in the following figure.\n",

    "# Scramble matrices\n",
    "In order to solve a puzzle, the pieces have to be moved around and rotated. I will refer to a series of movements and rotations as a scramble. These scrambles can be represented as matrices, which can be applied to the puzzle vector. A scramble matrix can be constructed as follows:\n",

    "* For each side in the puzzle, find its original position $a$ and its scrambled position $b$. Set the entry at row $b$ and column $a$ to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few constraints to this scramble matrix. Each row and each column in the matrix can only have a single entry that is equal to one, since all sides in the original puzzle have to be present in the scrambled puzzle, and sides can not be duplicated or destroyed. It is also not possible to move sides independently, since they are connected to puzzle pieces.

Each row that corresponds to checking two sides that face each other is repeated twice, since the check is made once for each side in the pair.

    "# Random scrambles and scramble similarity\n",
    "Since we now know how to generate a puzzle that has at least two solutions given an arbitrary scramble, we can generate a random scramble and build a puzzle with multiple solutions using that. However, it is important to keep in mind that the scramble can't be completely arbitrary: only corner pieces can occupy the corners of the jigsaw puzzle, and only edge pieces can occupy the edges, and their orientation is determined by which edge they're on. All middle pieces can be arbitrarily rearranged and rotated. Any scramble that conforms to these rules is valid, and can be used to construct a puzzle vector $\\vec{p}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video, Matt Parker also wants the two solutions to a puzzle to be as different as possible. One way of quantifying how similar the puzzle is after being scrambled is to count how many sides are adjacent to each other in the scrambled puzzle that were also adjacent in the original puzzle. This is easily countable: if every connecting shape in the original puzzle is unique, then every pair of sides that is still able to connect after scrambling the puzzle are sides that were connected in the original puzzle. This means that if a puzzle vector $\\vec{p}_u$ is constructed so that no two connections have the same shape, the number of edges in the puzzle is denoted as $n_\\text{edges}$, and $n_\\text{non-zero}$ is equal to the number of non-zero entries in the vector $\\mathbf{V}\\mathbf{T}\\vec{p}_u$, the similarity of the puzzle after being scrambled is equal to\n",

However, the previous constraints on the entries in those rows and columns are now redundant, as are the constraints on the rows and columns themselves. This means that $\\frac{3}{4}(2\\times4\\times4wh-16) = 24wh - 12$ constraints on all the entries in the rows and columns can be removed, and $8$ constraints on the sums of the rows and columns affected. If the piece is placed next to one more neigbouring pieces, there may also be some constraints due to connection shapes that are now redundant, but we'll ignore that for now in order to obtain a maximum bound on the number of constraints. This means that the sum of added constraints on matrix entries when placing the first piece is $8wh - 4$, while the sum of removed constraints on the rows and columns of the matrix is $8$.\n",

    "# Finding puzzles\n",
    "Here, we find the verification matrix for a given width and height. Then we generate random scrambles until one is found where no two sides that were adjacent in the original puzzle are adjacent after the scramble. We then find a puzzle that is solved in both its unscrambled state and the state that results from the scramble we found. We then check that this puzzle doesn't have any connections that are repeated more than the maximum. If it does not, we check that it does not have any pieces that are duplicates of each other (i.e. have the same connections in the same order). If the puzzle meets all these conditions, we try to find all solutions for it. If the puzzle has only two solutions, it is returned, and a figure is drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is doable for $5\\times5$ puzzles, seems to work for $5\\times6$ puzzles, and seems to get completely bogged down for $6\\times6$ puzzles. I think the solution finder needs to be made much more efficient in order to handle those.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also suspect that the best way to generate puzzles more quickly is to find some smarter way to generate the scrambles, rather than generating them randomly and checking if they meet our criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rerun all the code in this notebook to see an illustration of a puzzle with only two solutions. With the default settings, this should happen almost immediately. Lowering the value of maximum_repeated_shapes should increase the runtime, but give more satisfying puzzles with fewer connection repetitions. Increasing the value of width and height should increase the runtime drastically. I've never seen it complete for a $6\\times6$ puzzle so far."
