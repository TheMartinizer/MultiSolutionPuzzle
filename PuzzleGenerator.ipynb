    "# Generating puzzles with multiple solutions\n",
    "Puzzles with multiple solutions can create very interesting effects, such as the puzzle shown in the video \"[How can a jigsaw have two distinct solutions?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5nElEbbnfU)\" on the Stand-Up Maths Youtube channel where the two ways of solving the jigsaw puzzle either create an image of a coffee cup or a donut. This page describes how such puzzles can be generated by first picking a random scrambling of the puzzle pieces, and then generating a puzzle that is solvable in both its unscrambled and scrambled state. There is also Python code."

    "# Describing puzzles using vectors\n",
    "In order for a jigsaw puzzle to be solvable in more than one way, there must be several connections between pieces that have the same shape. Otherwise, if every connection was unique, each side of a piece would only be able to connect with a single side of a single other piece, and there would only be a single solution to the puzzle. This means that each side of each puzzle piece can be grouped with other puzzle piece sides with a similar shape, and these groups can be given numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to give the shapes numbers so that shapes that are compatible with each other have inverse numbers. For example, shape 1 is compatible with shape -1, shape 2 is compatible with shape -2, and so forth. This makes it easy to check whether two shapes are compatible: they are compatible if they add up to 0, and incompatible if they do not. I prefer to think of the positive numbers as all the shapes that stick out and the negative numbers as the indented shapes, but this is fully arbitrary. Finally, the outer sides of the pieces at the edge of the jigsaw puzzle are just shaped like straight lines, and do not connect to anything. These non-connecting shapes are labelled 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "A puzzle can be described mathematically as a vector containing the shapes of each side of all the pieces of the puzzle. The order of the sides is also arbitrary, but here we order the sides in order left, top, right, bottom, starting with the top left piece and going row by row. The ordering of sides for a 2x2 puzzle is illustrated in the following figure.\n",

However, it is important to keep in mind that the transformation can't be completely arbitrary: only corner pieces can occupy the corners of the jigsaw puzzle, and only edge pieces can occupy the edges, and their orientation is determined by which edge they're on. All middle pieces can be arbitrarily rearranged and rotated.\n",

One way of quantifying how similar the puzzle is after being scrambled is to count how many sides are adjacent to each other in the scrambled puzzle that were also adjacent in the original puzzle. This is easily countable: if every connecting shape in the original puzzle is unique, then every pair of sides that is still able to connect after scrambling the puzzle are sides that were connected in the original puzzle."

    "In order to achieve the effect in the video where the puzzle motif changes from a coffee cup to a donut, the puzzle should only have two solutions, otherwise it would be possible to put it back together in different ways that create nonsensical motifs. Since the above method guarantees that a puzzle has *at least* two solutions, we need to count the number of possible solutions to ensure that the puzzle has *only* two solutions.\n",

I haven't been able to prove this, but experience shows that $\\mathbf{V}$ is always non-invertible, so I don't think there exists a better way of finding $\\mathbf{T}$ than trial and error. However, there are some constraints on $\\mathbf{T}$ that narrow the search space. Any given row or column in $\\mathbf{T}$ can only have a single 1, since sides in the original puzzle can not be copied or destroyed. Any sides that belong to the same puzzle piece must also be moved and rotated together, which gives additional constraints.\n",
