    "# Generating puzzles with multiple solutions\n",
    "Puzzles with multiple solutions can create very interesting effects, such as the puzzle shown in the video \"[How can a jigsaw have two distinct solutions?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5nElEbbnfU)\" on the Stand-Up Maths Youtube channel where the two ways of solving the jigsaw puzzle either create an image of a coffee cup or a donut. This page describes how such puzzles can be generated by first picking a random scrambling of the puzzle pieces, and then generating a puzzle that is solvable in both its unscrambled and scrambled state. There is also Python code."

    "# Describing puzzles using vectors\n",
    "In order for a jigsaw puzzle to be solvable in more than one way, there must be several connections between pieces that have the same shape. Otherwise, if every connection was unique, each side of a piece would only be able to connect with a single side of a single other piece, and there would only be a single solution to the puzzle. This means that each side of each puzzle piece can be grouped with other puzzle piece sides with a similar shape, and these groups can be given numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to give the shapes numbers so that shapes that are compatible with each other have inverse numbers. For example, shape 1 is compatible with shape -1, shape 2 is compatible with shape -2, and so forth. This makes it easy to check whether two shapes are compatible: they are compatible if they add up to 0, and incompatible if they do not. I prefer to think of the positive numbers as all the shapes that stick out and the negative numbers as the indented shapes, but this is fully arbitrary. Finally, the outer sides of the pieces at the edge of the jigsaw puzzle are just shaped like straight lines, and do not connect to anything. These non-connecting shapes are labelled 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "A puzzle can be described mathematically as a vector containing the shapes of each side of all the pieces of the puzzle. The order of the sides is also arbitrary, but here we order the sides in order left, top, right, bottom, starting with the top left piece and going row by row. The ordering of sides for a 2x2 puzzle is illustrated in the following figure.\n",

However, it is important to keep in mind that the scramble can't be completely arbitrary: only corner pieces can occupy the corners of the jigsaw puzzle, and only edge pieces can occupy the edges, and their orientation is determined by which edge they're on. All middle pieces can be arbitrarily rearranged and rotated. Any scramble that conforms to these rules is valid, and can be used to construct a puzzle vector $\\vec{p}$.\n",

This is easily countable: if every connecting shape in the original puzzle is unique, then every pair of sides that is still able to connect after scrambling the puzzle are sides that were connected in the original puzzle. This means that if a puzzle vector $\\vec{p}_u$ is constructed so that no two connections have the same shape, the number of edges in the puzzle is denoted as $n_\\text{edges}$, and $n_\\text{non-zero}$ is equal to the number of non-zero entries in the vector $\\mathbf{V}\\mathbf{T}\\vec{p}_u$, the similarity of the puzzle after being scrambled is equal to\n",

    "Locking in a puzzle piece in the scramble matrix means setting a $4\\times4$ section of the matrix to one of $\\mathbf{R}_0$, $\\mathbf{R}_1$, $\\mathbf{R}_2$, or $\\mathbf{R}_3$, and represents locking in that a certain piece should be moved to a certain place and given a certain orientation.

This means that locking a piece in place constrains the value of $2\\times4\\times4wh - 16 = 32wh - 16$ entries in the scramble matrix. (The $-16$ term is to avoid double counting the constraints on the entries at the intersections of the rows and columns that are being constrained). However, the previous constraints on the entries in those rows and columns are now redundant, as are the constraints on the sums of the rows and columns. This means that $\\frac{3}{4}(2\\times4\\times4wh-16) = 24wh - 12$ constraints on all the entries in the rows and columns can be removed, and $8$ constraints on the sums of the rows and columns affected. If the piece is placed next to one or more neigbouring pieces, there may also be some constraints due to connection shapes that are now redundant, but we'll ignore that for now in order to obtain a maximum bound on the number of constraints. This means that the sum of added constraints on matrix entries when placing the first piece is $8wh - 4$, while the sum of removed constraints on the rows and columns of the matrix is $8$.\n",

    "However, care must be taken when placing subsequent puzzle pieces, as each subsequent locked row and column will intersect with each of the previously locked rows and columns.

We then check that this puzzle doesn't have any connections that are repeated more than the maximum. If it does not, we check that it does not have any pieces that are duplicates of each other (i.e. have the same connections in the same order).
