    "# Generating puzzles with multiple solutions\n",
    "Puzzles with multiple solutions can create very interesting effects, such as the puzzle shown in the video \"[How can a jigsaw have two distinct solutions?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5nElEbbnfU)\" on the Stand-Up Maths Youtube channel where the two ways of solving the jigsaw puzzle either create an image of a coffee cup or a donut. This page describes how such puzzles can be generated by first picking a random scrambling of the puzzle pieces, and then generating a puzzle that is solvable in both its unscrambled and scrambled state. There is also Python code."

    "# Describing puzzles using vectors\n",
    "In order for a jigsaw puzzle to be solvable in more than one way, there must be several connections between pieces that have the same shape. Otherwise, if every connection was unique, each side of a piece would only be able to connect with a single side of a single other piece, and there would only be a single solution to the puzzle. This means that each side of each puzzle piece can be grouped with other puzzle piece sides with a similar shape, and these groups can be given numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to give the shapes numbers so that shapes that are compatible with each other have inverse numbers. For example, shape 1 is compatible with shape -1, shape 2 is compatible with shape -2, and so forth. This makes it easy to check whether two shapes are compatible: they are compatible if they add up to 0, and incompatible if they do not. I prefer to think of the positive numbers as all the shapes that stick out and the negative numbers as the indented shapes, but this is fully arbitrary. Finally, the outer sides of the pieces at the edge of the jigsaw puzzle are just shaped like straight lines, and do not connect to anything. These non-connecting shapes are labelled 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "A puzzle can be described mathematically as a vector containing the shapes of each side of all the pieces of the puzzle. The order of the sides is also arbitrary, but here we order the sides in order left, top, right, bottom, starting with the top left piece and going row by row. The ordering of sides for a 2x2 puzzle is illustrated in the following figure.\n",
